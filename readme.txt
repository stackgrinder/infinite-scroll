Automatically append the next page of posts (via AJAX) to your page when a user scrolls to the bottom. 

== Description ==

Infinite Scroll adds this functionality to your wordpress installation: When a user scrolls towards the bottom of the page, the next page of posts is automatically retrieved and appended. This means they never need to click "Next Page", which dramatically increases stickiness.

Features:

*   Fully customizable by text, css, and images.
*   Works on 80% of wordpress themes, with little or no configuration.
*   Hackable source code to modify the behavior.
*   Tested back to 2.3, but probably works on earlier versions.
