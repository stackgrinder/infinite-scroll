Automatically append the next page of posts (via AJAX) to your page when a user scrolls to the bottom. 

== Description ==

Infinite Scroll adds the following functionality to your wordpress installation: **When a user scrolls towards the bottom of the page, the next page of posts is automatically retrieved and appended**. This means they never need to click "Next Page", which *dramatically increases stickiness*.

Features:

*   Fully customizable by text, css, and images.
*   Works on 80% of wordpress themes, with little or no configuration.
*   Hackable source code to modify the behavior.
*   Tested back to 2.3, but probably works on earlier versions.
*   Requires no (hopefully) template hacking, only a knowledge of CSS selectors.
